# ChillVirtualScheduling
An appointment scheduling website that allows select users to sign up for and schedule a meeting with their advisor.

Developed for a class that revolved around the .NET framework. Made with C#, MicrosoftSQL, and pizza.
Programmers: Jonas Fuller, Ekaterina Molostvova, Weston Laity

The website is split into two parts, the advisor and advisee. Advisor accounts are made by the admin of the system. An advisor can then log in, edit their profile, send invites to the website to advisees, and post available hours. Advisees can log in when they're invited by their advisor. Then they can go into their advisor's available hours and reserve time with them. They can also add a note to the meeting, which the advisor will get with the notification. The advisee will also get an email verification with a ICS file for their appointment.
