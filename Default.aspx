<!-- Program: Advisor Scheduling
    Programmers: Jonas Fuller, Kat Molostvova, Weston Laity
    Date: 13 Dec 2018
    Desc: An assignment for a .NET class. This program is a student to advisor scheduling for the next semester.
            An advisor will create a profile (they would have to be added through the backend), add office hours, 
            and then add their students. Students will get an email to set up their account, which will use a 
            verification code and email. Students can then choose appointments for times the advisor has made 
            available. -->
